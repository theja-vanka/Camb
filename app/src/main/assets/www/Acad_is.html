<p class="normal" align=justify>When <strong><em>computer and communications technologies</em></strong> are combined, the result is <strong><em>information technology, or</em> </strong><strong><em>&#8220;InfoTech</em></strong><strong><em>&#8220;</em></strong><em>.</em> There is a swift convergence in the areas of computing and communications as a result of relations developing in the data and information environment .IT professionals perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases, data management, networking, engineering computer hardware, database and software design as well as the management and administration of entire systems.</p>
<p class="normal" align=justify>In recent times, <strong>&apos;software development and IT enabled services&apos;</strong> have emerged as a niche opportunity for India in the global context. Today, the term information Technology has ballooned to encompass many aspects of computing and technology, and the term has become very recognizable. The information Technology umbrella can be quite large, covering many fields.</p>
<p class="normal" align=justify>The Information Science program, prepares the student to design and manage computerized data processing and decision support. The program is technically oriented emphasizing the design and implementation aspects of large scale information systems as well as the more traditional, managerial and organizational issues. It also balances development of systems engineering skills with learning to deliver reliable systems on time and within a specified budget.</p>
<p class="normal" align=justify>The department strives to provide a conductive environment for the students to develop analytical and practical skills and apply them to real world problems. To motivate the students the department organizes regular training in state of art software &amp; hardware, arranges workshop, National &amp; International Conferences periodically.
